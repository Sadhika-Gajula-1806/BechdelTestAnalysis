#  Bechdel Test Movie Dataset ‚Äì README

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes the representation of women in movies using the **Bechdel Test**, which assesses whether a film features:
1. At least two named women,
2. Who talk to each other,
3. About something other than a man.

The goal is to study historical trends and understand how gender representation has evolved over time in the film industry.

##  Dataset Overview
This dataset contains a comprehensive list of movies spanning from the late 1800s to the 20th century, with key attributes for each movie. It is intended to be used for **Bechdel Test analysis**, movie trend analysis, or historical film studies.

##  File Name
- `getAllMovies.json`

## Data Description
Each movie entry in the JSON file includes the following fields:

- **id**: Internal identifier for the movie
- **imdbid**: IMDb identifier for cross-referencing additional data
- **title**: Title of the movie
- **year**: Year the movie was released
- **rating**: A numeric value that could represent user ratings, test results, or other scores (interpretation may depend on the context of usage)

##  Suggested Use Cases
- Track the number of films released each year and their average ratings
- Analyze historical trends in film genres, production, and rating scores
- Merge with other datasets (e.g., Bechdel Test results, revenue, cast info) to enrich analysis

##  Objectives
Once merged, this dataset can help answer:
- What percentage of movies from each decade pass the Bechdel Test?
- Do higher-rated movies correlate with passing the test?
- Are movies with female leads more likely to pass?
